 <h2>Description.</h2>
 <p>Lasagna is a hearty, comforting dish that's perfect for gatherings or family dinners. Feel free to add vegetables, such as spinach or mushrooms, to the layers for extra flavor and nutrition.</p>
 <h3>ingredients:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
  <li>1 pound ground beef or ground Italian sausage</li>
  <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>24 ounces marinara sauce</li>
  <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Steps:</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, then drain and set them aside.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef (or Italian sausage) over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
  <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic to the skillet with the meat. Sauté until the onions are soft and translucent.</li>
  <li>Stir in the marinara sauce, dried oregano, and dried basil. Simmer for a few minutes, then remove from heat.</li>
  <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
  <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a small amount of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer three lasagna noodles on top.</li>
  <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a portion of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
  <li>Repeat the layers, starting with more meat sauce, then noodles, ricotta mixture, and cheeses.</li>
  <li>Finish with a final layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
  <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown.</li>
  <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
 </ol>
