 <h2>Description.</h2>
 <p>Baked potatoes are a simple and delicious side dish that can be customized with a wide range of toppings to suit your taste. They're perfect for any meal or as a standalone snack.</p>
 <h3>ingredients:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Russet potatoes (as many as you need)</li>
  <li>Olive oil</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Toppings of your choice (e.g., butter, sour cream, cheddar cheese, chives, bacon bits)</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Steps:</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>Preheat your over to 425°F (220°C).</li>
  <li>Scrub the potatoes thoroughly under cold water to remove any dirt. Pat them dry with a paper towel.</li>
  <li>Pierce each potato a few times with a fork to allow steam to escape during baking. This helps prevent the potatoes from bursting.</li>
  <li>Rub each potato with a thin layer of olive oil. This will help the skin become crispy during baking. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt.</li>
  <li>Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet. Bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork. The exact time may vary depending on the size of the potatoes.</li>
  <li>To check for doneness, squeeze the potato gently. It should yield to pressure, and the skin should be crispy.</li>
  <li>Once the potatoes are done, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool slightly for a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Slice open each baked potato and fluff the insides with a fork. Add your favorite toppings like butter, sour cream, cheddar cheese, chives, bacon bits, or any other toppings you prefer.</li>
  <li>Serve your baked potatoes hot, and enjoy!</li>
